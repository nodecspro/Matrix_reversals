# 🚀 Matrix Reversals: A Python-based Matrix Calculator

## 😊 Introduction

Matrix Reversals is a Python-based matrix calculator that facilitates the calculation of matrix inverses using the Gauss elimination method. This project features a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) developed using the tkinter library, making it accessible to both novice and experienced users.

## 💡 Project Purpose and Background

This project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to calculate the inverse of a matrix using the Gauss elimination method. The need for this project arose from the difficulty in finding a user-friendly GUI-based matrix calculator that can handle large matrices. Our project aims to fill this gap by providing a GUI-based calculator that is easy to use and understand.

## 🛠️ Features and Functionality

* Choose matrix dimensions via a combobox.
* Input matrix values using a user-friendly interface.
* Calculate the inverse of the matrix.
* Handles singular matrices and displays appropriate error messages.
* Utilizes the numpy library for matrix operations.
* Enhances GUI with ttk library for widgets.
* Exception handling for error management.
* Lambda functions for input validation.

## 🔧 Technology Stack

* Python
* tkinter library for GUI development
* numpy library for matrix operations

## 💡 Installation and Setup

* Clone the repository using git clone command
* Install Python and necessary libraries (tkinter and numpy)
* Run the program using Python command (python main.py)
* The program will start with a GUI interface. Follow the instructions to input matrix values and calculate the inverse.

## 📚 Usage Examples

1. Select the desired matrix dimension from the combobox.
2. Click the "Create matrix" button to input matrix values.
3. Enter matrix values in the grid of entry widgets.
4. Click the "Calculate inverse matrix" button.
5. The inverse matrix is displayed in a new window.
